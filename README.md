Consume an API
**************
Write a simple responsive application which mimics the behavior of
https://github.com/trending . The application should have a header section, a left
sidebar, a footer and a content area.

The content area should show a list of repositories with their name, description,
contributors & stars. This list should be both sortable and searchable by name, owner,
and stars.

Use the trending list and search from the Github API to query for repositories.

<h2>Used technologies: Laravel & VueJS</h2>
